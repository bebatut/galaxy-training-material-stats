- **Analysis of molecular dynamics simulations**
  - Pro:
    - The explanation is easy to undrstand (*2019-11-29 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - It could be nice if you can explain RMSD in context of Molecular drug design and protein ligand interactions with more examples. (*2019-11-29 00:00:00*)
    - Analysis of Rg, Hydrogen bonds can also be explained (*2020-05-21 00:00:00*)

- **Protein-ligand docking**
  - Pro:
    - The whole process of creating molecules (*2019-11-11 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - A video or two illustrating the end goal  (*2019-11-11 00:00:00*)

- **Running molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS**
  - Pro:
    - Interpretation of the results and being easy to follow (*2020-01-11 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Adding more explanation on how to visualize the trajectory, completing the analysis, also showing how to perform this run with a ligand also will be highly appreciated. (*2020-01-11 00:00:00*)

- **Setting up molecular systems**
  - Pro:
    - The feeling of creating something on my own  (*2019-11-18 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Nothing  (*2019-11-18 00:00:00*)
