- **Genome Annotation**
  - Pro:
    - good description of what annotation is (*2019-04-08 00:00:00*)
    - text is kept to a minimum (*2019-07-10 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - did not tell me how to do annotation using tools present here, would like a step by step instruction on how to do an annotation if I have a genome sequence (*2019-04-08 00:00:00*)
    - better overview of annotation process, more graphical instructions (*2019-07-10 00:00:00*)

- **Genome annotation with Maker**
  - Pro:
    - The first steps of the tutorial are great, described in a simple and objective way.  (*2019-02-27 00:00:00*)
    - Analysis for tutorial should be done on large datasets like genome from population rather than on individual genome.   (*2019-05-12 00:00:00*)
    - nothing (*2019-11-13 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - I was unable to continue from the "Hands-on: Run I look for the genome" stage. I looked for the BUSCO tool on the Galaxy platform but nothing was found. For this reason I could not complete the tutorial.  It would be good to evaluate the availability of this tool or change this step of the tutorial so that we can finish successfully, thank you! (*2019-02-27 00:00:00*)
    - There is no Maker in Galaxy (*2019-04-15 00:00:00*)
    - everything no vid (*2019-11-13 00:00:00*)

- **Genome annotation with Prokka**
  - Pro:
    - So good (*2019-01-24 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - I am doing this tutorial 09/2018 -> the step using the JBrowse tool works only (at least in my hands) with this version: (Galaxy Version 1.12.5+galaxy0) i had troubles finding it (maybe the search does not work properly?) (*2018-09-21 00:00:00*)

    - bit more detailed explanation would have been nice. (*2019-04-01 00:00:00*)
