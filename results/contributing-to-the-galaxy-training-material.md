    - 1) In situations where I'm working on a feature "F1" in branch "B1", while I prepare to make a PR, do I need to keep my local up-to date with Upstream before PR?  2) After deciding my feature branch is good to go for PR, can I checkout to Master and pull my feature first? What's the process for updating my Master with my new feature I developed?  Please answer this. I always have this confusion. Thanks. (*2020-04-20 00:00:00*)
