- **Age prediction using machine learning**
  - Pro:
    - Very good examples (*2020-07-06 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - I don't know anything about ML and I started with this tutorial (because it's the first lesson) and I think it is more complicated than the following ones, maybe it could be a future Lesson. I also have problems understanding about pipelines, but it could be me (*2020-07-06 00:00:00*)

- **Basics of machine learning**
  - Pro:
    - very straightforward tutorial (*2019-03-08 00:00:00*)
    - This was a helpful example for how machine learning can be applied to a real-world dataset. (*2019-03-18 00:00:00*)
    - Easy way to use machine learning (*2019-07-06 00:00:00*)
    - Strict, explicit instructions on what settings to enter into which category, leaving no room for ambiguity. (*2020-04-25 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Add more info on how to access the SVM Classifier tool. This tool does not seem to be available in the US Galaxy instance, but it is available in the EU Galaxy instance. (*2019-03-18 00:00:00*)
    - maybe more information or link for understand each advanced parameters (*2019-07-06 00:00:00*)
    - Specifying where exactly to find "Support vector machines (SVMs) for classification". This entry shows up both under Statistics and Machine Learning, and with no immediate indication of which one to use - likely because they're both the same tool. (*2020-04-25 00:00:00*)

- **Classification in Machine Learning**
  - Pro:
    - The explanation and description are easy to follow and understand. (*2020-06-25 00:00:00*)
    - confusion matrix (*2020-06-25 00:00:00*)
    - Easy to follow (*2020-07-02 00:00:00*)
    - Amazing, easy to follow and very usefull examples of the differents ML models (*2020-07-07 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - It would be better if all the evaluation plots of different models (e.g. Confusion matrix) were put together. Then it's easier to have an overview of performances. (*2020-06-25 00:00:00*)
    - 20 - even though the default value of the number of estimators for Bagging Classifier is 10, 20 gives the best accuracy. Not for me. Both 50 and 10 have better results for me. I guess because we did not set a random seed.  "Now, we will predict age in the test dataset using this model." "Hands-on: Predict age" This is copy&paste from the regression tutorial. Actually we are predicting if the molecules are biodegradable.  "Figure 13 shows that we again achieved an AUC value of 1.00" That's figure 12. (*2020-06-25 00:00:00*)
    - Data takes a lot of time to execute (*2020-06-25 00:00:00*)
    - Nothing (*2020-07-02 00:00:00*)

- **Clustering in Machine Learning**
  - Pro:
    - Easy instructions, good interpretation (*2020-06-26 00:00:00*)
    - Self-explanatory well structured instructions (*2020-06-26 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - More interpretation (*2020-06-26 00:00:00*)
    - The applications of these methods on life science large datasets (*2020-06-26 00:00:00*)

- **Introduction to deep learning**
  - Pro:
    - Exhaustive and extensive introductory chapter, easing readers into complex concepts without the need for in-depth prior knowledge. (*2020-04-25 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - The English used in the introductory section is spotty, containing grammatical errors and incorrect use of prepositions in many places. It misattributes terminology to mathematics when said terms more properly belong to neural networks or programming. The text contains types, such as Figure 1 being referred to as Figure 3 in at least one place. (*2020-04-25 00:00:00*)

- **Machine learning: classification and regression**
  - Pro:
    - Short and efficient primer (*2019-09-02 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - The theory behind the method in this particular example could be more expanded (*2019-09-02 00:00:00*)

- **Regression in Machine Learning**
  - Pro:
    - clear self-explanatory steps for execution (*2020-06-23 00:00:00*)
    - It's nice that the output plots are shown and some parts/questions are hidden and you just need to open them if you dont know.  (*2020-06-23 00:00:00*)
    - The description of each step is really clear. In the end the "key points" is also good. (*2020-06-23 00:00:00*)
    - The webinar is well organized and adherence to timing was apt and accurate. (*2020-06-23 00:00:00*)
    - Clarity and detail. (*2020-06-23 00:00:00*)
    - The steps were easy to follow (*2020-06-24 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Tutorial steps are different in the latest Galaxy and should take a review (*2020-06-20 00:00:00*)
    - N.A (*2020-06-23 00:00:00*)
    - At the beginning, all files are renamed which helps to follow the tutorial, but later on, this parts are being skipped and you can get lost  it is very bad to find the tools for first use. the search box is not working properly. I know its a galaxy problem, but you should state in the tutorial were to find the tools! (*2020-06-23 00:00:00*)
    - Pre-work shop reading materials should be made available to registered participants , say two weeks before the webinar/workshop proper. (*2020-06-23 00:00:00*)
    - Nothing I can think of... (*2020-06-23 00:00:00*)
    - In one place you write: “Select input data file”: test_rows_labels_without_header.csv Here the ".csv" suffix is not needed because it's not part of the name we gave to it. It's tabular file anyway.  In multiple places the figure references are wrong:  The residual plot shown in figure 9 -> figure 7  To infer how its values exhibit model performance, we can compare the figures 7 and 8. -> figures 8 and 9  Figures 5, 6 and 9 show that the prediction is acceptable -> figures 5, 6 and 7  The idea of cross-validation is shown in figure 3. -> figure 12  (*2020-06-24 00:00:00*)
    - The principle behind the steps (*2020-06-24 00:00:00*)
