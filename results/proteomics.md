- **Annotating a protein list identified by LC-MS/MS experiments**


- **Detection and quantitation of N-termini (degradomics) via N-TAILS**

  - Con:
    - still to complex to make sense (*2019-04-26 00:00:00*)

- **Label-free versus Labelled - How to Choose Your Quantitation Method**
  - Pro:
    - Detailed of both technique are very concise and helpful (*2019-06-01 00:00:00*)
    - The microscopic information (*2019-07-05 00:00:00*)
    - it simple, useful  for people who is not  trained in MS field (*2019-10-28 00:00:00*)
    - it was clear and straight-forward. Very easy to follow (*2019-12-14 00:00:00*)
    - Clear explanation of the pros and cons.  (*2020-01-16 00:00:00*)
    - very detailed (*2020-03-02 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - More details could have been added (*2019-07-05 00:00:00*)
    - how the difference among instruments may affect the  measures (*2019-10-28 00:00:00*)
    - Data analysis pitfalls can be elaborated. (*2020-01-16 00:00:00*)

- **Peptide and Protein ID using OpenMS tools**
  - Pro:
    - Well explained, great background information - my favourite was the greedy group resolution (*2018-09-29 00:00:00*)

- **Peptide and Protein ID using SearchGUI and PeptideShaker**
  - Pro:
    - Background info such as: The explanation of 'doubtful' for all levels (*2018-10-03 00:00:00*)
    - Tutorial is absolutely awesome! Thaks a lot for the work you made!  (*2018-12-05 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - SearchGui crashed with the database containing mycoplasma, with human and crap database it worked (*2018-10-03 00:00:00*)
    - Maybe you could make the tutorial more detailed. Write all the commands exactly as they should be written in the terminal. I catch lots of failures and can't improve them by myself.( (*2018-12-05 00:00:00*)

- **Protein FASTA Database Handling**
  - Pro:
    - Many details and background information (*2018-09-29 00:00:00*)
    - Easily explained with lot of interactive information about publishing data and archiving data analysis  (*2018-10-04 00:00:00*)
    - It is easy to follow. It saved me a lot of time and effort trying to generate this database (*2018-11-08 00:00:00*)
    - Extremely clear and easy to follow (*2020-05-22 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Fasta merging parameter How are sequences judged to be unique? should be set to 'Accession only' (*2018-09-29 00:00:00*)
    - A way to check your results are consistent with, for example, a master/reference database. (*2018-11-08 00:00:00*)
    - Maybe add the subheadings in the tool library under which the specific tools can be found (*2020-05-22 00:00:00*)
