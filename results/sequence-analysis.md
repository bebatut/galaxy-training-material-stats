  - Con:
    - More details on the Selection of analysis mode (non default option) (*2019-07-15 00:00:00*)
    - In step 1 of "Hands-on: Mapping with Bowtie2" your instructions mention that the paired-end input is the output of Trim Galore!. However, the previous tutorial on quality control uses MultiQC. As such, the reader of this tutorial will be confused.  In "Hands on-Inspect a BAM/SAM file" the 11 fields listed in the tutorial (QNAME, FLAG...) do not match with the 10 field names in the output produced (QNAME, FLAG, RNAME, POS, MAPQ, CIGAR, MRNM, MPOS, ISIZE, SEQ). The JBrowse viewer, doesn't work for me, get an error (*2019-07-18 00:00:00*)

  - Con:
    - the answers that are given to questions could be a bit more elaborate and give a/or link to a more detailed explaination (*2018-09-17 00:00:00*)
    - Not clear that Trim Galore and FastQ are integrated into Galaxy. Uncertain how obtained 97,644 sequences after trim galore of bad data (I got 99,341). (*2018-09-22 00:00:00*)
    - the webpage output for MultiQC is not functioning (*2018-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - More details regarding others output sections of FastQC tool (*2018-10-08 00:00:00*)
    - how to rmemeber steps.... (*2018-10-31 00:00:00*)
    - Doesn't need to be (*2018-11-28 00:00:00*)
    - often ambiguous (*2018-12-01 00:00:00*)
    - what is the next step? (*2018-12-10 00:00:00*)
    - more precise knowledge like FASTQC is all data copy and paste from their original source need more easy way explain of documentation    (*2018-12-27 00:00:00*)
    - MultiQC didn't work (*2019-01-25 00:00:00*)
    - specificity of quality check regarding the type of data (16S, whole genome) (*2019-03-20 00:00:00*)
    - suggestion of several programs that can be used eg for trimming (Trim Galore...) (*2019-04-08 00:00:00*)
    - You could including how to do FastQC scripts (*2019-04-24 00:00:00*)
    - Probably as we are not trimming any adaptors in this tutorial, Trimmomatic can also be used on datasets provided. (*2019-05-14 00:00:00*)
    - quality of audio in presentation (*2019-06-11 00:00:00*)
    - In your tutorial, you state "In this training, no adapters were already removed". What does this mean? That adapters were not removed? Then why do we not remove them in the tutorial? From a grammatical point of view your sentence is confusing. Do you mean "In this training, adapters were not yet removed"? (*2019-07-17 00:00:00*)
    - don't know (*2019-07-27 00:00:00*)
    - Examples can be included.  (*2019-08-15 00:00:00*)
    - Considering SNP in the analysis, practice adapters removal ?  (*2019-08-21 00:00:00*)
    - Figuring out why the mapping tutorial directed me here to quality control fastq files then they will not work... (*2019-08-23 00:00:00*)
    - More examples (*2019-09-04 00:00:00*)
    - provide images of what the results should look like. Also, there are a few typos like 'how many basepairs has been removed' instead of 'how many base-pairs have been removed' (*2019-09-14 00:00:00*)
    - I was already familiar with fastqc and cutadapt so I don't know (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - The available paremeters per step should be more elaborated in order to understand how we can use them in other context and queries (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - More detailed explanations regarding the utilities of each available tool (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - at some points sound is not good (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - Use more examples (eg for problematic datasets) (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - To show more of the bad quality examples (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - for me it was not clear when you use this tools for example multi qc and what are the results (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - explain more the available options of each menu and the biological meaning of each choice (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - Please wait a little bit each time you act on the website (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - Sound issues. Need of a better microphone? Could also be the speakers in Estonia. (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - More explanation and better voice quality. (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - Provide example data where 3-4 paired end samples provided. Especially, how to analyse and visualize QC data for multiplex samples.  (*2019-10-08 00:00:00*)
    -  Not much really (*2019-10-11 00:00:00*)
