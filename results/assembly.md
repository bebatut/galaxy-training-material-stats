- **De Bruijn Graph Assembly**
  - Pro:
    - Everything works with provided data and the scale is good for use in class (*2018-09-19 00:00:00*)
    - Easy to follow (*2019-03-25 00:00:00*)
    - examples (*2019-10-25 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Could you provide the fragment size separating the paired ends? It would also be nice to have more info for instructors about the genome for doing additional exercises based on the assemblies. (*2018-09-19 00:00:00*)
    - command lines (*2019-10-25 00:00:00*)

- **Introduction to Genome Assembly**
  - Pro:
    - This is a great tutorial. Saved me a lot of time. Well done and thank you. (*2019-03-13 00:00:00*)
    - the real data analysis (*2019-06-03 00:00:00*)
    - all in this tutorial are so usefull (*2019-07-12 00:00:00*)
    - on galaxy portal lot of assembler are available, but most of the scaffolders are not working or unavailable. (*2019-09-13 00:00:00*)
    - Step by Step instructions (*2019-10-21 00:00:00*)
    - the hands on exercises (*2020-04-18 00:00:00*)
    - The pace and the content covered are great!!! (*2020-06-09 00:00:00*)
    - Simple enough. (*2020-07-02 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Similar tutorials for other bioinformatics exercise. If all tutorials on the web were this easy to follow everybody would know what they're doing. :) (*2019-03-13 00:00:00*)
    - provide links to the tool side by side (*2019-06-03 00:00:00*)
    - i dont know (*2019-07-12 00:00:00*)
    - need good genome ascaffolder or soapdenovo tool (*2019-09-13 00:00:00*)
    - i seems to be abit slow (*2019-09-20 00:00:00*)
    - i seems to be abit slow (*2019-09-20 00:00:00*)
    - Feeding in multiple samples at the same time for FastQC (*2019-10-21 00:00:00*)
    - There was no Icarus viewer (*2020-04-18 00:00:00*)
    - There isn't much information to give the learner the background to interpret their own data. There should be an introduction of what each of the parameters specified for the hands-on session means and why the learner should be setting them as instructed. That's the only way to know whether this tutorial is suitable for the learner's own dataset to follow.  (*2020-07-02 00:00:00*)

- **Making sense of a newly assembled genome**
  - Pro:
    - Although tutorials are available on numerous tools used in bacterial genomics, most of them stop at assembly and annotation part. But questions on comparative genomics and the way the output data is interpreted is important to develop questions and find answers. Would like to have more of such tutorials with inferences (*2020-02-08 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Everything is great. Comparing genomes for finding key pathways and functional capability would be great in upcoming tutorials (*2020-02-08 00:00:00*)
    - I miss some screenshot of how my data should look. At one point, in one of the steps where I had to choose some columns from a matrix to work on, I kept getting a wrong result. And I think the reason was, that I had something different in some of the columns than what I should have (so if for example I was asked to choose column 1, the data I was trying to get was actually in column 2) - if there were some screenshots of what the data should look like, I might have been able to see if I had a column too much (*2020-04-01 00:00:00*)

- **Unicycler Assembly**
  - Pro:
    - THE INFO USED (*2019-02-08 00:00:00*)
    - easy to follow, step by step (*2019-04-16 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - THE WAY OF EXPLAINING (*2019-02-08 00:00:00*)

- **Unicycler assembly of SARS-CoV-2 genome with preprocessing to remove human genome reads**
  - Pro:
    - The format and outlining are fantastic (*2020-04-22 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Add a screen shot or graphic to illustrate the major steps in this workflow (*2020-04-22 00:00:00*)
